	Final Project: Solving the Heat Equation in 2 Dimensions
	
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CONTENTS:

The directory "finalproject" contains 2 files: this readme file "readme.txt" as
well as the makefile "Makefile".

It also contains the 2 subdirectories "c" and "fortran"
 
The "c" directory contains a header file "header.h" with the function
prototypes, a file "functions.c" which contains input/output functions, and
a file "project.c" which contains the main program. 

The "fortran" directory contains a file "subroutines" with the module and
input/output subroutines and a file "main.f90" which contains the main program.

Each of these subdirectories each has 3 additional files: a file called
"heat-sample.inp" which is a default file for input values, a file called
"output.txt" which serves as a default file for output values, and another
Makefile specific to the subdirectory in order to facilitate cleaning. 


INSTRUCTIONS:

To build the program in both C and Fortran, simply navigate to the directory
"~/finalproject" and type "make" into the terminal. To build just the C 
executable, type "make c"; to build just the fortran, type "make fortran".
The executable files will appear in their respective subdirectories. 

To build the fortran executable "project-f90" while  in the "fortran"
subdirectory, type "make" or "make fortran" (either will work)

To build the C executable "project-c" while in the "c" subdirectory, type 
"make" or "make c" (either will work)

!!!!!!!!! NOTE: the default compilers are gcc and gfortran !!!!!!!!!!

The programs require 3 command line arguments: a string specifying the input file
name, an integer specifying the frequency of the output, and a string 
specifying the output filename. The C program takes an option fourth argument
(which can be anything) that pipes the output straight to gnuplot (v.4.6 and later)
and generates a timeseries heatmap. To make this look nice, generate only 5 timesteps
or so. For example, to run the program, enter 

./program input_filename frequency_of_output output_filename

for instance,

./project-c heat-sample.inp 25 output.txt

The default names for the executable files are "project-c" and "project-f90" 

specifying a fourth argument for "project-c", e.g.,

./project-c heat-sample.inp 25 output.txt foo

will open a window in gnu plot and show several timesteps; if
you get an error, please install the latest version of gnuplot (4.6.5).

Use make clean to remove all *.o files and the program executables.
